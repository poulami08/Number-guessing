# THE PERFECT GUESS

*In this game, the program generates random number but this number is not visible to the player.*

*Player tries to guess the number. If the player enters the same number that is generated by system then program displays the winning message and game ends there.*

*If the player enters wrong number then that number is evaluated. If the number is greater than right answer than system gives a hint “Lower number please” otherwise if number is smaller than right answer than it says “higher number please”.*

*User has unlimited chances to guess the number but when his/her attempts are lowest for correct answer then program displays the high score message and the number is saved as highest score in a txt file.*
